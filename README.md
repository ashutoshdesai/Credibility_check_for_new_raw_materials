# Credibility_check_for_new_raw_materials
Check for the suitability of new raw materials for a process as a replacement to the existing one

Problem statement: 

You work for a pottery manufacturing company that produces two different types of products A and B. Product A uses raw material from Llanedyrn and Product B uses raw material from Isle Thorns and Ashley Rails1. Your company is informed that Llanedyrn will be closing soon for maintenance and your entire production of product A is at risk. You received a potential new source of raw material from site Caldicot and you analyzed two samples to compare them to your existing samples from the other three sites. As the new data scientist of the company you are asked to look into the data and give your recommendation regarding the suitability of raw material from Caldicot as a replacement for Llanedyrn. The ask "look into the data" normally calls for an unsupervised learning exercise, since there is no clear output you are asked to predict. You will investigate the multivariate chemical composition of the raw material from four dierent sources using Principal Component Analysis.

Result:

The raw material from Caldicot is a good replacement for Llanedyrn
